        Technology, the catalyst of modern human revolution, has rooted its
        megabytes, gigabytes and terabytes into every neuron and synapse of our
        human brains, conquering the whole world with its enigma in the process.
        In this age, where information has become synonymous to power; with
        technology as its driving force, the need for a club in Notre Dame
        College for the young tech enthusiasts couldn't be more. You asked for
        it. We made it happen. Notre Dame Information Technology Club (NDITC), a
        co-curricular activities club of the prestigious Notre Dame College, has
        started its journey on 2018, to promote and support learning and
        interaction within areas related to information systems and technology,
        to share new ideas and to encourage recreational activities in these
        areas. "Innovate and Encode Your Ideas" bearing this motto, the club has
        been established. Being the first club of Notre Dame College devoted to
        encourage the students to take part and make contribution to the ever
        evolving IT sector, NDITC is dedicated to set an example. The club
        aspires to encourage its members to discover their untapped zeal for
        information and technology. NDITC aims to give the necessary guidelines
        and opportunity and act as the leading light in spreading technological
        awareness among the pupils. Information and technology, with their own
        conundrum, are expected to create students who are up-to-date with the
        current world, being led by this sincere institution of knowledge. The
        club has taken the solemn oath to uphold the rich history of Notre Dame
        College through our activities and ignite the thirst for knowledge about
        the technology world within the students which, we believe, will
        construct the pathway towards a technologically advanced nation.
